# Malware Protection Using AWS Network Firewall

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure **AWS Network Firewall** to block access to known malicious websites, preventing malware downloads and improving network security.

### What is Malware?
Malware (malicious software) includes viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware. It can steal data or damage computer systems.

### Objective
To protect users from accidentally downloading malware by using **AWS Network Firewall** rules that block malicious URLs.

---

## Scenario
**AnyCompany** experienced incidents where employees accidentally downloaded malware from certain websites. As a security engineer, your task is to update the firewall to block these malicious URLs.

---

## Architecture
- AWS VPC with a pre-configured **Network Firewall (LabFirewall)**  
- An **EC2 instance (TestInstance)** used to test connectivity  
- Stateful rule groups for malware URL blocking

---

## Tasks Summary
1. **Confirm Reachability** – Verify access to malicious URLs using `wget`.
2. **Inspect the Network Firewall** – Review and update the firewall policy.
3. **Create a Firewall Rule Group** – Add Suricata-based IPS rules to block malware URLs.
4. **Attach the Rule Group** – Apply rule group to the firewall policy.
5. **Validate the Solution** – Confirm that access to malicious URLs is now blocked.

## Task Details

### 🧩 Task 1: Confirm Reachability
1. Connect to **TestInstance** via Session Manager.  
2. Run:
   ```bash
   wget http://malware.wicar.org/data/js_crypto_miner.html
   wget http://malware.wicar.org/data/java_jre17_exec.html
